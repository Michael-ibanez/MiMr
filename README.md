The purpose of this project is to create an application alongside a website that will track a user's time by acquiring the number from the application and store it under their name. When a user wants to see how much time they've spent, they can view a total amount of hours per week. This will hold a user's time sheet for up to three years. 


In the future we plan to add features such as adding employers and employees where the employer can have several employees and view each of their time sheet history.
